# Hello, world!

Nice one! You're up and running. This site was generated from the contents of your `docs` folder. It
currently is made of two pages. This one, and `examples.md`, which you can visit by clicking on the
link on the left side of the page. You can get back to this page by clicking the top left title of
the page.

## Let's add another page

All of your documentation lives under the `docs` directory. You can start adding markdown files, and
when running the `serve` command you will see changes automatically updated in the browser.

Try it - add a new markdown file under `docs`, paste the content below, and watch what happens.

```markdown
---
title: Another page
---

# Adding new pages is that simple
```

When you hit save, you should see the left side navigation has updated, and a link to your new page
shows up.
